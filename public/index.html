      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
      Tofu generates one-time passwords to help you protect your online
      accounts. These passwords are used together with your normal password when
      you sign into services like Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Amazon, and GitHub.
      </p>
      <p>
      Tofu works with all services that provide two-factor authentication using
      the HOTP and TOTP algorithms. It does not require a network or cellular
      connection and can be used in airplane mode.
      </p>
      <p>
      Tofu is open source and free software licensed under the ISC license. The
      source code is available for review and modification on
      <a href="https://github.com/calleluks/Tofu">GitHub</a>.

      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <dl>
        <dt>What is two-factor authentication?</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>
        Two-factor authentication requires you to provide two separate means of
        identification when you sign into your online accounts. One is commonly
        something you know, e.g. your password, and one is something you
        possess, like your iPhone.
        </p>
        <p>
        Using two-factor authentication requires someone to have both your
        password and your iPhone to get into your account. This makes your
        account much harder to hack and hijack.
        </p>
        <p>
        Many online services provide two-factor authentication by requiring you
        to enter a one-time password in addition to your normal username and
        password. To generate this password, a shared secret is required. Tofu
        stores this secret securely in your iPhone's keychain and generates the
        password for you.
        </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
        What is the difference between two-factor authentication, 2FA, and
        two-step verification?
        </dt>
        <dd>
        There is no difference. They all refer to the same concept.
        </dd>
        <dt>
        How do I prevent being locked out of my account if I lose access to my
        iPhone?
        </dt>
        <dd>
        <p>
        Online services that support two-factor authentication generally provide
        so called backup or recovery codes during the setup process. If you lose
        access to your iPhone, you can use one of these codes instead of the
        one-time passwords generated by Tofu. It is really important to keep
        these safe. We recommend either printing them on paper to store
        somewhere safe, or saving them in a password manager such as
        <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a secondary level of protection, accounts in Tofu are also included
        in iOS backups. To be able to restore these on a new iPhone, backups
        must be made using iTunes or Finder on the Mac, and have to be password
        protected. Tofu's accounts will not migrate to a new iPhone, when
        restoring from an iCloud backup. This is true for all apps that store
        accounts in the iOS Keychain and there's currently no way for us to
        affect this. We hope Apple will change how iOS backups work in the
        future.
        </p>

        <dt>
        How do I move my accounts to a new iPhone?
        </dt>
        <dd>
        The only automated way of moving your Tofu accounts to a new iPhone is
        to restore a password protected backup of the old iPhone made with
        iTunes or Finder on the Mac. It is also possible to manually deactivate
        and then re-activate two-factor authentication for each of your
        accounts, scanning the new QR codes using Tofu on the new iPhone.
